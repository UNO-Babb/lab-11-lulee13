Wait times tend to be higher when the simulation length is greater.
There is a seemingly exponentialish increase in wait times as you reduce the number of checkers.
As I have the simulation set right now, the difference between 3 checkers and 4 checkers is HUGE.
Playing with computer simulations is fun.
